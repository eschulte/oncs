* how to include a library that needs to create state
i.e., a header file that creates its own local variables... should it
have an init function?

maybe just add an init function like with the IXM collector

* other message types
- refresh (or some such) to indicate to a higher level portion of your
  structure that you have changed
- ready to be applied (for when I become a lambda and want to let the
  next level up know) -- although this would require up-pointers

* is it worth holding pointers to higher level
similar to the =env= pointer in earlier instantiating

* reverse-- lambdas matching lambdas with their applications
while
: (\lambda ..tons of stuff..)(argument)
seems like it would require lots of message passing to apply, the same
isn't true for
: (...tons of stuff...\lambda)(argument)

the key is just to start the application from the next level up
